# Development Guidelines

This section collects project-wide guidance to keep contributions consistent, safe, and easy for humans and LLMs to use.

## What's inside

- [Requirements](./requirements.mdx) — Set up your environment (Python, tooling, pre-commit)
- [Coding Styles and Rules](./coding-style.mdx) — Code conventions, typing standards, and quality tools
- [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.mdx) — Test pyramid, how to run tests, and coverage map
- [MCP Tool Development Guidelines](./mcp-tool-development.mdx) — LLM-first tool design, naming, input/output models, and unified ToolResponse envelope
- [How to create a new mapper](./how-to-create-a-mapper.mdx) — Step-by-step guide for DTO ↔ Domain ↔ Output mappers with examples and a Mermaid flowchart

## When to use these

- You are preparing your dev environment or CI locally
- You are implementing a new feature or MCP tool
- You are adding or refactoring tests
- You are aligning tool inputs/outputs for LLM comprehension and token efficiency

## Next steps

- New contributor? Start with [Requirements](./requirements.mdx) and [Coding Styles and Rules](./coding-style.mdx)
- Building/adjusting tools? Refer to the MCP Tool development doc for best practices.
- For model layering and mapping patterns (DTO → Domain → Output), see [Architecture: Models](/docs/development/architecture/models).
- For a step-by-step guide to creating a new mapper, see [How to create a new mapper](/docs/development/guidelines/how-to-create-a-mapper).
- Verifying behavior? Follow the [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.mdx)
