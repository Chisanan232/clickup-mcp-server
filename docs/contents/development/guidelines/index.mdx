# Development Guidelines

This section collects project-wide guidance to keep contributions consistent, safe, and easy for humans and LLMs to use.

## What's inside

- [Requirements](./requirements.mdx) — Set up your environment (Python, tooling, pre-commit)
- [Coding Styles and Rules](./coding-style.mdx) — Code conventions, typing standards, and quality tools
- [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.mdx) — Test pyramid, how to run tests, and coverage map
- [MCP Tool Development Guidelines](./mcp-tool-development.mdx) — LLM-first tool design, naming, input/output models, and unified ToolResponse envelope

## When to use these

- You are preparing your dev environment or CI locally
- You are implementing a new feature or MCP tool
- You are adding or refactoring tests
- You are aligning tool inputs/outputs for LLM comprehension and token efficiency

## Next steps

- New contributor? Start with [Requirements](./requirements.mdx) and [Coding Styles and Rules](./coding-style.mdx)
- Building/adjusting tools? Go to [MCP Tool Development Guidelines](./mcp-tool-development.mdx)
- Verifying behavior? Follow the [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.mdx)
