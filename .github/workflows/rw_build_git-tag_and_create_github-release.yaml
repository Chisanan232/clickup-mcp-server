# Workflow Description:
#     Build a git tag on a specific commit in every git branch. And create GitHub release if current git branch is 'master'.
#
# Workflow input parameters:
#     * General arguments:
#         * project_type: Different project type would get the software version info in different way.
#         * debug_mode: It would run the tasks as log message, doesn't essentially run feature if this option is true.
#         * project_name: The project name.
#         * software_version_format: The format of software version.
#
# Workflow running output:
#     Yes, it has running result output. The output is the release version.
#
#     * Workflow output:
#          It would output the version which would be build as git tag and create GitHub release version title.
#         * python_release_version: Python project release version info.
#         * github-action_reusable_workflow_release_version: GitHub Action reusable workflow project release version info.
